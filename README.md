Filechecker2 is a tool to keep track of / move / work with files stored at multiple locations (even if they are offline). The tool itself does not do the "file operations", it utilizes [CopyCommander2](https://github.com/PascalCorpsman/CopyCommander2) for that.

## What needs to be done to compile Filechecker2

To be able to compile the code you need the [Lazarus-IDE](https://www.lazarus-ide.org)

Inside Lazarus you need to install the following packages:
- L-Net from [almindor](https://github.com/almindor/lnet) or [PascalCorpsman](https://github.com/PascalCorpsman/lnet) use the online Packagemanager to install (recomended to use the PascalCorpsman version)
